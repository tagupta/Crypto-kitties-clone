# Ethereum Dapp Crypto Kitties

Building the Crypto Kitty clone.

## About
This is a project I built while studying how to program a decentralized application (dApp) for the Ethereum blockchain at Ivan on Tech Academy. It's my own version of the popular CryptoKitties game on Ethereum, which allows users to buy, collect, breed and sell virtual kitties living on the blockchain.

Each kitty in the dApp is an ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) - a unique digital item controlled solely by the owner of the NFT. Users of the dApp can design and create kitty NFTs, combine two kitties to breed a new kitty which randomly inherits traits from its parents, and they can buy or sell these NFTs on a non-custodial marketplace using cryptocurrency (ETH).

This dApp was built using:
* HTML 5
* Java script
* Bootstrap 5
* Solidity 0.8
* OpenZeppelin
* Truffle
* Ganache
* Web3.js
* MetaMask

## Access DApp on Testnet
1. Make sure you have [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) installed to interact with web 3.0 content in the browser.
2. In MetaMask, switch the blockchain network from ```Ethereum Mainnet``` to ```Ropsten Test Network```.
3. Get some testnet ETH from an Ethereum Ropsten faucet like [this one](https://faucet.dimensions.network/).
4. After cloning the app in Visual Studio, run the python server by using command  ```python -m http.server 8000```.
5. Access the dApp in the browser [here](http://localhost:8000/index.html).
6. Now you're ready to use the dApp running on the Ethereum **Ropsten testnet**!
